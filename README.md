ImpactHedge is a decentralized on-chain crypto asset management platform based on Algorand blockchain. It establishes a transparent and flexible marketplace for asset management services to meet the diverse needs of investors and asset management service providers, by connecting investors and fund managers, allowing ordinary investors to enjoy professional asset management services, allowing fund managers to obtain funds and diversified investment tools.

ImpactHedge enables users to passively implement an asset management strategy by owning an ASA token and fund managers to execute a strategy which others can follow.

Investors can view the allocation of funds by the fund manager at any time without worrying about the safety of the fund and the illegal operation of the fund. On the other hand, while the flow of money is transparent on the ImpactHedge protocol, fund managers can preserve their specific algorithms for their strategies to incentivise innovation in investment strategies.

We aim to be community owned and employ decentralised governance to the protocol. 

Mission
ImpactHedge strives to provide a decentralized investment gateway that is easy to use and accessible for millions of people to shape their financial future.
